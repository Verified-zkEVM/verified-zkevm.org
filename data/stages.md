## Stages

### Stage 1 (Ongoing)
The goal of Stage 1 is to start from the ground up and establish maintainable and extensible frameworks that will allow us to formally verify specific artefacts later in the project.

Applications are particularly welcome (but not restricted to) to address the following:
*   (RISC-V zkVM track) Frameworks to formally verify properties of circuits and arithmetizations.
*   (RISC-V zkVM track) Frameworks to formally verify zkVM precompiles.
*   (EVM track) Approaches to formally verify EVM implementations. (Note: there is currently limited scope for this given that the EVM used by zkVMs is primarily revm.)

For work related to formalizing proof systems, please see [ArkLib](https://github.com/Verified-zkEVM/ArkLib).

### Stage 2
Stage 2 will be starting soon with a greater focus on proving properties of deployed software than in Stage 1, as well as introducing bounties where possible.
