<!-- ## Project Overview -->

The Ethereum Foundation is running this project to obtain the highest possible level of assurance for zkEVMs, the end goal being bug-free zkEVMs.
This project will feature a combination of grants and bounties, with the project likely running until the end of 2026.

This project aims to:
*   Develop and apply state of the art formal verification methods to the zkEVM stack, developing tooling, standards, and maintenance processes along the way;
*   Raise awareness of formal verification methods applied to zkEVMs;
*   Increase coordination between different teams in the ecosystem.

### Format & Philosophy

This is community project, with the aim of benefitting from existing ecosystem expertise as well as developing it.

Different problems have different solutions, and somestimes several good solutions are available.
We aim to support different approaches to benefit from the diverse set of tools and expertise in the ecosystem, as well as to compare different approaches in terms of not only their end results but also the effort required to produce and maintain them.
Shared methods/languages for interacting components are preferred.
High standard of openness and documentation is expected to facilitate evaluation and collaborative work on complex projects.

As zkVMs evolve, there is a crucial need for maintainability and extensibility. We aim to support development and the push for greater performance, not slow it down.
