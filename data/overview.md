## Project Overview

The Ethereum Foundation is launching this project to obtain the highest possible level of assurance for zkEVMs, the end goal being bug-free zkEVMs.
This project will feature a combination of grants and bounties, with the project taking place until the end of 2026.

This project aims to:
*   Raise awareness of formal verification methods applied to zkEVMs.
*   Increase coordination between different teams in the ecosystem.
*   Develop tooling, standards, and maintenance processes for evolving verification targets.

### Format & Philosophy

#### Supporting Different Approaches
We support varied expertise to compare approaches (effort, maintainability, etc.). If one approach proves superior, we may focus on it. Shared methods/languages for interacting components are preferred.

#### Maintenance
Crucial focus on maintainability and extensibility as zkVMs evolve. We aim to support development, not slow it down.

#### Openness
High standard of openness and documentation is expected to facilitate evaluation and collaboration.
